# four-bit-adder-subtractor
This project implements a 4-bit adder/subtractor using Ripple Carry Adder (RCA). It performs addition when M=0 and subtraction (using 2â€™s complement) when M=1. The design is verified via waveform simulations and test cases. Inputs: A[3:0], B[3:0], M, cin. Outputs: S[3:0], Cout.
